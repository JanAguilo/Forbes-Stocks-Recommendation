# Should I Trust Forbes for Investment Recommendations?

During the summer of 2024, I found myself fascinated by stocks and investing. Like many aspiring investors, I was eager to find trustworthy sources to guide my decisions. One day, I stumbled across a Forbes article titled "Top Undervalued Stocks to Buy â€“ September 2024", which listed 8 "undervalued" stocks that were supposedly strong buys.

But then I thought, Should I really trust Forbes for investment advice? Could their recommendations actually lead to profitable investments, or were they just generic picks without much substance? I decided to explore this question through a small personal project.

This notebook represents my journey of digging into the numbers, analyzing the stocks Forbes recommended, and answering the question: Do these recommendations hold up over time?

## What Does This Project Do?

To evaluate the Forbes-recommended stocks, I:

1. Replicated Forbes' metrics: I calculated the same financial indicators they likely used, such as:
    - Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF)
    - Price-to-Earnings (P/E)
    - Price-to-Book (P/B)
    - Dividend Yield
2. Tracked stock performance: I monitored how the prices of these stocks changed over the next 3 months.
3. Assessed portfolio returns: By assuming an equal investment in all 8 stocks, I calculated the overall portfolio's performance.

## Why Did I Do This?

This project was driven by curiosity:
- Are articles like Forbes' genuinely useful for retail investors, or are they just noise?
- Can we trust widely circulated "top stock" lists to guide real investment decisions?
- How do the recommended stocks perform against their metrics and over time?
